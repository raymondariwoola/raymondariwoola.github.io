'Here is an example VBA script that can be used to import the contents of multiple Excel files from a folder into a single Excel workbook:

Sub ImportExcelFiles()
    Dim fso As Object
    Dim folder As Object
    Dim file As Object
    Dim wb As Workbook
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim i As Integer
    Dim lastRow As Long
    
    'Set the folder path
    folderPath = "C:\example\"
    
    'Create a new worksheet
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Add
    ws.Name = "Imported Data"
    
    'Create a File System Object
    Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    
    'Get the folder object
    Set folder = fso.GetFolder(folderPath)
    
    'Loop through the files in the folder
    For Each file In folder.Files
        'Check if the file is an Excel file
        If Right(file.Name, 4) = ".xls" Or Right(file.Name, 5) = ".xlsx" Then
            'Open the Excel file
            Set wb = Workbooks.Open(file.Path)
            
            'Get the last row of data in the first worksheet
            lastRow = wb.Sheets(1).Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
            
            'Copy the data from the first worksheet of the Excel file
            wb.Sheets(1).Range("A1:Z" & lastRow).Copy
            
            'Paste the data into the "Imported Data" worksheet
            ws.Range("A" & Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Offset(1, 0).PasteSpecial xlPasteValues
            
            'Close the Excel file
            wb.Close False
        End If
    Next file
End Sub


' You can run this script by opening the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) in Excel, creating a new module, and pasting the code into the module. You can then run the code by clicking the "Run" button or by pressing F5.

You should modify the folderPath variable to match the folder you want to import files from.

It's also important to note that this script will copy only the first sheet of the files, if you need to copy all the sheets you need to make small adjustments on the script.
